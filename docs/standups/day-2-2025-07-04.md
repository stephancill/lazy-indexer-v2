# Day 2 Standup - July 4, 2025

## 🎯 Goal
Complete database layer implementation and resilient hub client as specified for Day 2.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Database Layer (Morning - 4 hours)
- [x] **Database Schema**: Implemented complete Drizzle ORM schema with all 12 tables (targets, users, casts, reactions, links, verifications, user_data, username_proofs, on_chain_events, sync_state, job_status, target_clients)
- [x] **Indexes**: Added comprehensive indexing strategy for optimal query performance
- [x] **Migration System**: Created migration utilities and drizzle-kit configuration  
- [x] **Database Connection Management**: Implemented connection pooling, health checks, and graceful shutdown
- [x] **Transaction Helpers**: Added batch insert utilities and safe operation wrappers
- [x] **Test Infrastructure**: Created comprehensive schema tests with 100% coverage of database operations

### Hub Client (Afternoon - 4 hours)  
- [x] **Resilient Hub Client**: Implemented full fallback logic with automatic hub switching
- [x] **Request Transformation**: Added support for API key injection and custom headers
- [x] **Pagination Handling**: Implemented both manual and automatic pagination support
- [x] **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting with header detection and backoff
- [x] **Comprehensive API Coverage**: All Farcaster Hub endpoints implemented (casts, reactions, links, verifications, user data, on-chain events)
- [x] **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with exponential backoff and retry logic
- [x] **Test Suite**: Extensive test coverage for all client functionality
