## 🚀 Architecture Implementation

### Job Flow Design
```
Farcaster Hubs -> Realtime Worker -> Event Filter -> Process Event Queue
                                 -> Target Expansion -> Backfill Queue
                                                     
Target Database -> Backfill Worker -> Message Fetching -> Database Storage
                                   -> Graph Expansion -> New Targets

Redis Target Sets -> Fast Event Filtering -> Relevance Checking
```

### Worker Coordination
- **Backfill Queue**: Processes individual FID data fetching (concurrency: configurable)
- **Realtime Queue**: Polls for new events every 5 seconds (concurrency: 1)
- **Process Event Queue**: Handles message storage (concurrency: 10)

### Dynamic Target Management
- Root targets automatically discover new follows
- Client app monitoring adds new users as root targets
- Target set cached in Redis for millisecond lookup times
- Automatic cleanup of unfollowed users

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### Final State
- ✅ **Core Infrastructure**: Complete and functional
- ✅ **Worker Logic**: Implemented with comprehensive coverage
