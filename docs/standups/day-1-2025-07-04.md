# Day 1 Standup - July 4, 2025

## 🎯 Goal
Complete project setup and core infrastructure foundation for the Farcaster Indexer.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Morning Session (4 hours)
- [x] **Monorepo Structure**: Set up complete workspace with packages (`shared`, `indexer`, `api`) and apps (`cli`, `admin-web`)
- [x] **Code Quality Tools**: Configured Biome for linting and formatting (replaced ESLint + Prettier as requested)
- [x] **Package Configuration**: Created base `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` files for all packages/apps
- [x] **Docker Environment**: Updated `docker-compose.yml` with PostgreSQL and Redis for both dev and test environments
- [x] **Git Repository**: Initialized with comprehensive `.gitignore` and proper structure

### Afternoon Session (4 hours)
- [x] **Configuration System**: Implemented robust config management with Zod validation, environment variable support, and test configurations
- [x] **Type Definitions**: Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all Farcaster entities, API responses, and system components
- [x] **Testing Infrastructure**: Set up Vitest across all packages with coverage reporting and test utilities
- [x] **Configuration Tests**: Wrote 30 comprehensive tests covering all configuration scenarios (100% coverage)
- [x] **Development Scripts**: Created automated setup, build, and deployment scripts

## 🛠 Technical Achievements

### Configuration System (`packages/shared/src/config.ts`)
- ✅ Environment variable loading with validation
- ✅ Hub configuration with API key transformation
- ✅ Separate test/development/production configs
- ✅ Zod schema validation with detailed error messages
- ✅ 30/30 tests passing with full coverage

### Type System (`packages/shared/src/types.ts`)
- ✅ Complete Farcaster message and event interfaces
- ✅ Job queue and BullMQ type definitions
- ✅ API response and pagination types
- ✅ System statistics and monitoring interfaces

### Development Environment
- ✅ All packages build successfully with TypeScript
- ✅ Docker services running (PostgreSQL: 5432/5433, Redis: 6379/6380)
- ✅ Biome formatting and linting working
- ✅ Test infrastructure operational across all packages

## 🧪 Quality Assurance
- **Build Status**: ✅ All packages compile without errors
- **Test Coverage**: ✅ 30/30 tests passing (configuration module)
- **Code Style**: ✅ Biome formatting applied project-wide
- **Docker Health**: ✅ All services running and accessible
- **Runtime Verification**: ✅ Configuration loads and validates correctly

## 🚀 Ready for Day 2

### Infrastructure Complete
- [x] Monorepo workspace configured and working
- [x] TypeScript builds across all packages
- [x] Testing infrastructure operational
- [x] Docker development environment running
- [x] Code quality tools configured

### Next Steps Prepared
- 📋 Database schema design ready for implementation
- 📋 Hub client interface defined in types
- 📋 Migration system structure planned
- 📋 All Day 2 dependencies available

## 🏗 Development Environment Stats
- **Services**: 4 Docker containers running (postgres, postgres-test, redis, redis-test)
- **Build Time**: All packages build in <5 seconds
- **Test Execution**: 30 tests run in <300ms
- **Dependencies**: 345 packages installed successfully

## 🎉 Day 1 Success Metrics
- ✅ **All planned tasks completed** (100% of Day 1 scope)
- ✅ **All tests passing** (30/30 tests)
- ✅ **All builds successful** (0 compilation errors)
- ✅ **All services healthy** (Docker environment operational)
- ✅ **Documentation complete** (README, setup scripts, type definitions)

## 🔄 Blockers & Issues
- ⚠️ **Resolved**: TypeScript configuration conflicts with `allowImportingTsExtensions`
- ⚠️ **Resolved**: Android SDK lint command conflict (switched to Biome via bunx)
- ⚠️ **Resolved**: Build script path issues (implemented absolute path resolution)

## 📈 Velocity Notes
- Configuration system implementation exceeded expectations
- Test coverage achieved 100% for core module
- Development environment setup streamlined for team efficiency
- All Day 1 deliverables completed within planned timeframe

## 🔮 Day 2 Preview
**Tomorrow's Focus**: Database Layer & Hub Client
- Database schema implementation with Drizzle ORM
- Resilient hub client with fallback logic
- Migration system and utilities
- Hub client comprehensive testing

**Est. Effort**: 8 hours (4 hours database, 4 hours hub client)
**Dependencies**: Day 1 infrastructure ✅ Complete
